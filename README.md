# MaximumAreaCoverageOptimization

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Gabisanth/MaximumAreaCoverageOptimization.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Gabisanth/MaximumAreaCoverageOptimization.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This repository contains prototyping code developed for methodologies developed for MEng Thesis titled: Optimal Area Coverage and Trajectory Optimization for UAV Swarms. Certain scripts draw inspiration from the work conducted in the implementations by https://github.com/ZhengdaoLI0602/UAV_Path_Planning and https://github.com/Logan1904/FYP_Optimization.

# Running the scripts:
The main scripts are located within the "src" folder:
1. Run the "DynamicArea.jl" script. This simulates a forest fire scenario using cellular automation.
2. Run the "FullSimulation.jl" script with the desired conditions. This simulates the UAV swarm covering the growing forest fire.

# Visualising the simulations:
Visualisation scripts are provided within the "3D_UAV_Swarm_Visualisation" folder, which can be run with the Unity game engine.
